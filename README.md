# NS_MUD
This is a MUD (Mutli-User Dungeon) project aiming to implement the D&amp;D 5E ruleset in C++, working off of JMUD.

All credit for the jmud code and project goes to the original creators.
Their code is currently in this repository: we are NOT taking credit for, or making changes to this code.
It is simply posted so all team members on this project are working from the same base.

We will be using Git Flow to organize git use.
Please split new features into their own feature/ branch, and merge back to develop when you are finished. 
Master will be used to store working iterations of the project as they are completed.

I reccomend SourceTree by Atlassian for interfacing with Git and using Git Flow.
